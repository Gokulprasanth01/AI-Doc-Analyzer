Song Recommendation System. Scraped the data from the Spotify API using spotipy and extracted the audio
features for every song. Selected the features to be stored as a vector. For recommendations algorithms used are
Pairwise cosine similarity and K Means Clustering algorithms. Developed a flask web application in which users can
interact with the model to get recommendations.
Optimizing Intrusion Detection Sytem (IDS). The NSL KDD dataset was used for training and evaluating
the model. Three approaches where followed, which involves using HS for feature selection, using ABC for feature
selection and combining both the algorithms (HS+ABC) for feature selection. The resulting models were evaluated
on the basis of False Positive rate.
Driver Alertness System. By identifying the key aspects of a driver’s face, our algorithm can automatically
